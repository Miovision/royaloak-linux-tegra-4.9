	  This registers set at internal SMI address 0x1C provides extended
	  features like EEPROM interface, trunking, cross-chip setup, etc.

	  It is required on most chips. If the chip you compile the support for
	  doesn't have such registers set, say N here. In doubt, say Y.

	help
	  The MV88E6390 does not respond properly to the PORT_SWITCH_ID call, so we force it on by
	  use of this flag.
